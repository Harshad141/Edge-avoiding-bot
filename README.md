## COMPONENTS USED
### Arduino Uno
The Arduino Uno is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328.It has 20 digital input/output pins (of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs and 6 can be used as analog inputs), a 16 MHz resonator, a USB connection, a power jack, an in-circuit system programming ICSP) header and a reset button.

### IR Sensor
An infrared sensor is an electronic device, that emits in order to sense some aspects of the surroundings.These types of sensors measure only infrared radiation, rather than emitting it that is called a passive IR sensor.
